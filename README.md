# quant-dataset-lab
I chose this dataset as I am interested in the covid vaccination amount in the US and how much counties in the US deviate from the mean. I decided on studying a topic relating to Covid because of the relevance it has in our current lives. The data I found revealed the mean, median and standard deviation of Covid vaccinations across the country. The mean of all the values was 0.41660620199216036, the standard deviation 0.10703114092520966, and the median 0.40139062745293924. The median was a bit smaller than the mean of all the values meaning there are some more outliers on the greater half of the scale than the smaller half. With the standard deviation being so large in comparison to .4 (almost 1/4 of the mean) it shows how far the country was as the dataset was created in the past. It also demonstrated the polarity in our country to getting vaccines and not getting them, as well as our ability to pass out vaccines.
